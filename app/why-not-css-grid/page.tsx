          Every design system I’ve built eventually needs a 12-column grid, and
          CSS grid looks made for the job.{" "}
          <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr)</code> spells out the
          shape directly. So that’s where I started.

        <h2>Where it breaks</h2>
        <p>
          On most laptop viewports, a 12-column grid looks fine. Pull the slider
          below to shrink the container, and you’ll see items push past the
          right edge around 352px.

        <p>
          CSS grid builds a fixed-width scaffold. Gaps are set in concrete —
          they don’t shrink when the container gets smaller, they don’t wrap,
          they don’t collapse. For 12 columns, that’s 11 gaps × 32px (
          <code>gap-8</code>) = 352px of pure gutter. Narrower than that, and
          the grid spills.

        <h2>What about container queries?</h2>
        <p>
          The obvious refinement: <code>@container</code> queries that swap the
          column count at smaller widths — 12 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 2. Better than
          viewport media queries, since a grid inside a sidebar shouldn’t care
          about viewport width. But it doesn’t actually solve the problem. The
          layout snaps at thresholds instead of reflowing continuously, and
          spans don’t translate across breakpoints — half on a 12-col grid is{" "}
          <code>col-span-6</code>, on a 4-col grid it’s <code>col-span-2</code>,
          so every item has to restate its span at every breakpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s also <code>repeat(auto-fit, minmax(MIN, 1fr))</code> — a CSS
          grid pattern that fits as many equal columns as the container allows
          and drops one when it runs out. No breakpoints, no overflow. The
          catch: every column is the same width. You can’t put a one-third card
          next to a two-thirds card in the same row, which is the whole point of
          a 12-column grid.

        <h2>Why flex, not CSS grid</h2>
        <p>
          A grid primitive needs three things: continuous reflow as the
          container changes, per-item widths (a third here, a half there), and
          no overflow at any container size.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS grid gives you per-item widths but fights the other two.{" "}
          <code>auto-fit</code> gives you reflow and safety but locks you into
          uniform columns. Flex-wrap with percentage widths is the only approach
          that delivers all three.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teul builds on <code>flex flex-wrap</code>. Each item declares its own
          percentage width; items that don’t fit wrap to the next row, and the
          gaps wrap with them instead of sitting fixed in the container.
        </p>
        <p>
          The width formula falls out of that:{" "}
          <code>calc(size/12 × (100% + colGap) − colGap)</code>. The{" "}
          <code>+ colGap</code> term reserves a gap-sized chunk for each 1/12
          slot; the <code>− colGap</code> term subtracts the trailing gap that
          the last item in a row doesn’t need. When items wrap, the gaps wrap
          with them, and the formula stays the same.
